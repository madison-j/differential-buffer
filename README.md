# Quad channel differential buffer board

Set of four differential op-amps (AD8421); 10MHz bandwidth, low noise, variable gain settable with a resistor.

Idea here is to buffer monitor channels at the computer without introducing ground loops.

A set of three boards is available from OSHPark for $95; you can also send the gerbers to be manufactured at your board house of choice!
